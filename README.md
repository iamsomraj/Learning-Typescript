# Learning Typescript

I have created this repository to gain knowledge about Typescript. Also, I have not worked with typescript on a practical level. So, this will be a nice way to get used to it so that I can work on my React projects.


## Content

1. Fetchjson - Used TS for fetching data from a fake API ( you know which one ) :P

## Objectives

1. To learn about the syntax of Typescript
2. Used ts-nodes package for compiling TS and using Node, both at the same time
